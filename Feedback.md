## Good
- Connections to prior units
- A lot of group work, but not mandatory group work
- Collaboration, asking others for help
- Learning targets
- Website > slides
- repl.it

## Bad
- Timing on the assignments
- Certain amount of time to help each student
- Ask **three** before me
- "I feel like we grow more learning from each other."
