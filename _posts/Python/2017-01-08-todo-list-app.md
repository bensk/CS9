| Each key has a list value that stores items                                   |     1      |
| User is prompted                                                              |     1      |

| Use .split() to make `add Friday watch tv and relax` update the list          |     1      |
| **Total**                                                                     |   _ / 8    |

## Our notes

```python
# some way to add
# some way to read
# some way to KEEP asking until exit


some_dictionary={
    "monday":[]

    #days of the week
}

def add():
    # loop this question...
        #append the action to the list value of the day keys
        some_dictionary[day].append(action)
    #until you...
    # I need an option to call choice()

def get():
    print(some_dictionary[day])
    # I need an option to call choice()

def choice():
    user_choice = input("How can I help you?")
    # if they choose 'add' call add()
    # if they choose 'get' call get()
add("something", "monday")

get("monday")
```
