## Essential Questions
- What is code?
- What is programming?

- Comments help make your code understandable.
- Making mistakes it the best thing you can do.

- "It's okay to be lazy" being lazy doesn't mean you're not putting work into what you do it just means you do something complicated in a simple way.
- There is always a more simple/ lazy way to write code.
- Be specific in everything you do. Be ordered.
- Be creative and learn from your errors.

## Assessment Questions

## Questions for us to figure out

- What should the difficulty be for the very first lesson?
- What code would you like to teach first ?
- What are the "basics" of coding?
