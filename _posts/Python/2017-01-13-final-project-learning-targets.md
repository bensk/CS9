Our work from yesterday...

## Essential Questions
- What is code?
- What is programming?
- How are programs organized?
- How are different type of data used in programming?
- How can I solve problems using code?
- Why do we need programming?
- What is the point of coding?
- Is coding another type of language?
- How does coding help you in life?
- How does code relate to the subject you teach?

## Understandings
- Indentation matters, there will always be errors, and you're never finished.
- "Fall down seven times, get up eight."
- Comments help make your code understandable.
- Making mistakes it the best thing you can do.
- Failing is actually one of the best things because there is always a way to debug what you have programmed.
- "It's okay to be lazy" being lazy doesn't mean you're not putting work into what you do it just means you do something complicated in a simple way.
- There is always a more simple/ lazy way to write code.
- Be specific in everything you do. Be ordered.
- Be creative and learn from your errors.

## Assessment Questions
- Why do you want to learn about programing/coding?
- What does coding mean to you?
- How can we be specific when writing code?

## Questions for us to figure out
- How can you break down coding in the simplest way so someone can understand it?
- What should the difficulty be for the very first lesson?
- What code would you like to teach first ?
- What are the "basics" of coding?

The next step is to figure out what a student in your class should be able to do once it's over. At the end of class, they should be able to say "I can _____" and you should be able to assess that, yes, they can.

I developed 🎯 Learning Targets for this class. Do you remember the [👌 SNAP Learning Target Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kpCuR0VXGgyvjY0LeWGajOzOSJe31Ynk_cDWsI9pK6A/edit?usp=sharing) or the [🐍 Python Learning Target Tracker](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L2w9uPk6oqDY4ldzxK9OBJNJnK0DK4SMed49jbna4Uo/edit?usp=sharing)? Those are **assessments**.

We need to develop 2-3 _short-term_ learning targets for the students.

🎯 I can...   
🎯 I can...   
🎯 I can...

Review your Learning Targets from this semester. Which ones do you think could apply to the lesson we are planning? What have I missed?

### 📝 Assessment

Assessments are evidence. You're used to seeing them as tests or exit slips, but they're also reflections, rubrics, conversations, code you submit, drawings...whatever shows a teacher you've mastered an idea or a skill.

Any good lesson includes **formative** assessment that occurs _while_ people are learning and allows you to see where they're getting confused and need help (or where they are _destroying_ the work and need to pushed harder (👋 pretty much each of you at some point this semester).

Teachers also use **summative** assessments at the end of a unit, usually comparing students to a baseline or grade standards.

You will only be teaching for one day (at least for now), so you probably won't be giving a test. **BUT** – you still need to think about assessment.

Some questions I ask myself:

1⃣ How do I know students are learning while I'm teaching? How do I know where they're stuck?

2⃣ How many students are meeting my standards? How many are exceeding and need an extension?

3⃣ What can I adjust, right now, based on this information?

4⃣ What's next?
