🎯 **Learning Target:** I can create variables in Python.

👉 **Do Now:** Fill in as much of this Venn Diagram as you can:

## `return` to Python
_Remember this?_

Why does it say `Let's review Python`?

Last year, we used Python **2**. This year, we will be using Python **3**. There are a few important differences, but for today, the most important is this:

```python
# in PYthon 3, print is a FUNCTION:
print("hello there")
#   ^ parentheses ^
```

## Variables
Store a variable under a name.

| Name  | ONE Equal sign | Value  |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| name  | =  | SK  |
|grade|=|9|

### Rules for Variable Name
- Contains letters, numbers,  and underscores ( _ )
- Cannot start with number
- Cannot contain spaces  (you can use underscores used to separate words)
- Cannot use **keywords**

### 🔑words
Each programming language has a set of words that are _reserved_ by the language for programmatic purposes.

Some Keywords in Python are :  `print`, `False`, `True`, `else`, `if`

### Rules of 👍 for Variable Names


- Pick names that make sense. Someone _besides you_ should be able to figure out what your variables mean.
- Use underscores to separate words
- Python is **CASE SENSITIVE** which means `Num_marbles = 10` and `num_marbles = 10` are different.

### Datatypes

|Type  | Description  | Example  |
|---|---|---|
| String  | Any characters inside `""`  | `This is a string.`  |
| Integer  | Whole numbers  | `3`,`42`,`-1002`  |
| Float  | Numbers with decimals.  | `3.42`, `-10.02`  |
| Boolean  | Only two values  | `True`, `False`, `3>42`, `3.42>-10.02`  |


## Python Review

[Join our repl classroom](https://repl.it/classroom/invite/B6s697b).

- Create a variable called `my_name`  and store your name in it. Then print the variable.
- Create a variable called `multiply` that is the product of a negative number and a positive number with a decimal (not a whole number). Print the variable.
- Store a message in a variable. Then print the message.
- Create a variable that stores a Boolean value. Print the variable.
- Create a variable that stores a message. Then store another message in the same variable. Print the message.

### 🌶
Create a variable that is the quotient of two other variables (hint: you will need to store values in that variable first).

### 🌶🌶🌶

The operations between boolean values are AND and OR. Create a variable that store the value of True or False and then prints it. Create another value that stores the value of True and False. Print the variable.
