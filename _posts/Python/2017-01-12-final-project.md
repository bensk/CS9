## ‚è≥ Hour of Code

Every single student in your grade has written code...but many of your teachers have no idea what code even _is_.

That's where you come in.

For the rest of this assignment, when I say "student" I mean everyone who isn't in this class.

## üåà Understanding by Design

When we start thinking about planning a lesson, we try to start with the _end_ **first**.

> What should a student leaving your lesson be able to do when you're done teaching them that day?

For this semester, these were mine:

### ü§î Essential Questions

- What is a program?
- How are programs organized?
- How are different types of data used in programming?
- How can I solve problems using code?

### üí° Enduring Understandings

- Algorithms are precise sequences of instructions for processes that can be executed by a computer and are implemented using programming languages.
- A computer program is a sequence of instructions or steps, written in a language that can be understood by a computer, that will be used by the computer to complete a task or solve a problem
- Creativity is essential process for creating programs.
- Computing enables us to use our creativity to create programs for creative expression or to solve a problem.
- Multiple levels of abstraction are used to write programs
- Programs can be developed for creative expression, to satisfy personal curiosity, to create new knowledge, or to solve problems (to help people, organizations, or society).
- Programming uses mathematical and logical concepts.

That's a lot. The next step is to determine the **evidence** that tells the teacher whether or not students have mastered the material.

I developed üéØ Learning Targets for this class. Do you remember the [üëå SNAP Learning Target Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kpCuR0VXGgyvjY0LeWGajOzOSJe31Ynk_cDWsI9pK6A/edit?usp=sharing) or the [üêç Python Learning Target Tracker](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L2w9uPk6oqDY4ldzxK9OBJNJnK0DK4SMed49jbna4Uo/edit?usp=sharing)? Those are **assessments**.

### Assessment

Assessments are evidence. You're used to seeing them as tests or exit slips, but they're also reflections, rubrics, conversations, code you submit, drawings...whatever shows a teacher you've mastered an idea or a skill.

Any good lesson includes **formative** assessment that occurs _while_ people are learning and allows you to see where they're getting confused and need help (or where they are _destroying_ the work and need to pushed harder (üëã pretty much each of you at some point this semester).

Teachers also use **summative** assessments at the end of a unit, usually comparing students to a baseline or grade standards.

You will only be teaching for one day (at least for now), so you probably won't be giving a test. **BUT** ‚Äì you still need to think about assessment.

Some questions I ask myself:

1‚É£ How do you know students are learning while I'm teaching? How do I know where they're stuck?

2‚É£ How many students are meeting my standards? How many are exceeding and need an extension?

3‚É£ What can I adjust, right now, based on this information?

4‚É£ What's next?
