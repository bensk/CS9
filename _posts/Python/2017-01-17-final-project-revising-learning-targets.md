## Why are these bad ðŸŽ¯ Learning Targets?
- I can write code.
- I can understand the meaning of all coding.
- I can explain the interaction between code and a computer.
- I can explain block in SNAP.
- I can explain the meaning of coding.


## Needs Revision
- I can use math in _Python_.
- I can write **comments** in code and explain why we use them.
- I can identify the importance of laziness.
- I can explain "Efficiency" in Computer Science.
- I can make 3 shapes in _SNAP_.
- I can define what coding is.
- I can explain why coding can solve problems.
- I can identify different _coding languages_.
- I can define `if` and `else` statements.
- I can explain what **conditionals** are and how they work.
- I can build and code a _robot_.
- I can describe the role of **creativity** in Computer Science.
- I can define **algorithm** and give examples.
- I can explain in _writing_ the expected outcome of _a piece of code_.
- I can come up with specific **algorithms**.
- I can explain what **iteration** is and give examples.
- I can explain what programming is using basic knowledge of _Scratch_ blocks.
I can code for a function in _Python_ using what I know about cause and effect or **inputs** and **outputs** .
- I can make a _sprite_ move across the screen and bounce off edge .
- I can make a _sprite_ turn around.
- I can determine how **debugging** errors in Computer Science will help me in life.
- I can learn from my mistakes to make my work better.
- I can write a **conditional** statement .
- I can explain the idea of coding helping you in life.
- I can understand the overall idea of coding being a language .
- I can define an **algorithm** in code .

# Mastering Learning Targets

A human person cannot possibly master ALL of ðŸ‘† these in a single class.

A lot of them are similar or relatedâ€“ can we group them into separate lessons, and teach _some_ of them to _some_ of our learners?

Which ones make sense together? Which ones require a learner to have mastered an earlier target before they can attack this one?


## Bonus! Do Now idea (thanks, Jeremiah!)
In your own words, explain what "coding" is
