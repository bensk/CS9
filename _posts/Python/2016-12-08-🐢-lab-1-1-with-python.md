# Geometric Fun Times‚Ñ¢

In this lab, you will write a Python program to draw some simple shapes on the stage.

## 1. Drawing a square

Ask the user for the shape they would like:

```python
shape = input("What shape would you like")
```


1.1) Using Turtle, if the user says `square`, the computer should draw a square.

1.2) **Add code** so that the sprite **says the word "square"** while it is drawing.

Comment your code explaining your work.

## 2. Adding more shapes

2.1) Now that you've drawn a square, add code to draw the shapes in the following table. The user should be able to say the name of the shape and see it appear.

- Square
- Equilateral triangle
- Diamond
- Pentagon
- Parallelogram ("leaning rectangle")
- Star

You will probably want to draw a sketch of each to figure out the angles in each shape.

2.2) **Add code** so that as each shape is being drawn, the sprite is saying the name of shape.

2.3) **Modify** your code so that each different shape is drawn in a **_different_** color and with a **_different_** line **_thick_**ness. So, for example, if the square is drawn in **blue** with a line thickness of 3, each other shape must be drawn in a color that is **not** blue and with a line thickness that is **not** 3. You may choose whatever colors your want.

2.4) **Add** code so that the sprite is hidden when it is not drawing. This is will make sure that the sprite is not obstructing the view of your beautiful artwork!

3) **Comment your code!** What did you do? Where did you get stuck? How did you fix it?
