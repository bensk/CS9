## Do Now (in 🐍 CS9 Python)

Write a function called `hello` that takes two **parameters** a `name` and an `adjective` and combines them. It should work like this:

`hello('SK','awesome')`

`Hey SK, you are very awesome.`

## DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself

```python
dry = "Don't repeat yourself"
for x in dry:
    print(dry)
```

# Lab 2.1 - Geometric Fun Times v3.0™
Remember when you drew all those shapes? Didn’t it seem like it should be _easier_? Well...

Do you notice a pattern for the number of sides of a shape, the number of repeat and the turn 🔄 ___ degrees for each shape? Hmm…that’s interesting.

1⃣ `def`ine a function called `sides()` that asks for the number of sides and draws a regular polygon with that number of sides. For example, `shape(4)` would draw a square, `shape(5)` a pentagon, and so on.

2⃣ `def`ine a function called `angle()` that asks for a number of **degrees** to turn. This should work like `shape()`, but **every side should be a different color.** To make something pretty, test `angle(121)`.

This is `angle(200)`:
