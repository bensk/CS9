## ✍ Loop
Code that repeats **for** a certain number of times, or **while** something is true.

## ✍ `for` Loop
Code that repeats **for** a certain number of times.

```python
numbers = [1,2,3]
for x in numbers:
    print "This is number" + str(x)
```
    This is number 1
    This is number 2
    This is number 3

## Lists & Loops

What will print?

```python
numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]
for x in numbers:
    x = x/2
    print("This loop will repeat " + str(x) + " times")
```

## Practice

_Be sure to include comments as you code, explaining 1) what are you trying to do 2) where did you get stuck and 3) how you got unstuck._

**Looping through lists**

``` python
numbers = [2, 4, 244, 24, 13, 44, 53]
```

0. Write a for loop to print out each number squared
1. Write a for loop to print out three times the numbers in the list
2. Write a for loop to print out “My new favorite number is ” and then each number

**Conditionally Looping**

_There are multiple ways to solve these problems. Talk to you neighbors. Look at my starter code. Comment your work!_

🗜 Write a **for** loop to print only the **odd** numbers from this list

```python
list = [3,4,7,13,54,32,653,256,1,41,65,83,92,31]
```

🗜 Write code that prints out only the factors of a number input

```python
number = input("What number would you like the factors of? \n")
```

🗜 **Countdown** Write code that counts down from any number

```python
n= input("What number would you like me to start at? \n")
```
