## Learning Targets
I can create, modify, and access lists in SNAP.

## Do Now (on paper)
Write an algorithm to reverse the order of any sentence.
For example, your algorithm would make the Do Now turn into:

> “Sentence a of order the reverse to algorithm an write.”

## Pseudocode
`sentence = word_1 + word_2 + word_3 + … + word_n`

`ecnetnes = word_n + … + word_3 + word _ 2 + word_1`

We need **variables** But we don’t know **how many**.

## Variables vs. Lists
**Variables** store a single value in a single location.
**Lists** store multiple values in a single location.

## List Traversal

> Looking at each element of a list in order and performing some operation.

ex. Say each person's name, count the number of May birthdays, find the average GPA…

`index`

`split`

`join`

## Highway Writing
In SNAP, build a block to reverse the order of a sentence by word.

## Sdrawkcab
In SNAP, build a block that reverses the order of a sentence by splitting it into a list.
