## Learning Targets
I can create, modify, and access lists in SNAP.

## Do Now (on paper)
Write an algorithm to reverse the order of any sentence.
For example, your algorithm would make the Do Now turn into:

> ‚ÄúSentence a of order the reverse to algorithm an write.‚Äù

## Pseudocode
`sentence = word_1 + word_2 + word_3 + ‚Ä¶ + word_n`

`ecnetnes = word_n + ‚Ä¶ + word_3 + word _ 2 + word_1`

We need **variables** But we don‚Äôt know **how many**.

## Variables vs. Lists
**Variables** store a single value in a single location.
**Lists** store multiple values in a single location.

## Sdrawkcab
Build a SNAP block that reverses the order of a sentence by splitting it into a list.
