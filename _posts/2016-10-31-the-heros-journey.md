- "Hero" should clearly “face” the left when you push the `←` left arrow key
- "Hero" should perform an animated walk when you hold `←←`left or `→→`right arrow key

## Assessment

| Good programming habits in your code                                         |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Using Start and Stop blocks.                                                 |
| Making sure you initialize appropriately so that your program is repeatable. |
| Use conditionals and variables, not precisely timed waits.                   |
| Add comments to your code so it is easy to understand.                       |
