## By the end of today...
_In your planning doc:_

| Specification | Scripts |
|---|---|
| There is at least one on-ground enemy | |
| The enemy sprite moves towards "Hero" | |
| The enemy sprite reappears/rolls-over when it hits the edge of the stage | |
| The enemy sprite is animated when it is moving towards "Hero" | |
| If "Hero" does not jump, she runs into the enemy and the game ends with an appropriate message  | |
| It should be possible for "Hero" to jump over the enemy| |
