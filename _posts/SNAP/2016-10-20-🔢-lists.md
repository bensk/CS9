## Learning Targets
I can create, modify, and access lists in SNAP.

## Do Now (on paper)
Write an algorithm to reverse the order of any sentence.    
_For example, your algorithm would make the Do Now turn into:_

> “Sentence a of order the reverse to algorithm an write.”

## Pseudocode
`sentence = word_1 + word_2 + word_3 + … + word_n`

`ecnetnes = word_n + … + word_3 + word _ 2 + word_1`

We need **variables** But we don’t know **how many**.

## Variables vs. Lists
**Variables** store a single value in a single location.

**Lists** store multiple values in a single location.

## List Traversal

> Looking at each element of a list in order and performing some operation.

ex. Say each person's name, count the number of May birthdays, find the average GPA…

When working with lists, we need to create an `index` variable to keep track of position.

SNAP (and Python!) have built in `split` and `join` functions to **separate** lists into individual pieces of data, and to **combine** individual pieces of data into a list.

Let's get some practice:

Create a new SNAP project called "Lists." In that project, you will create

## 🛣 Highway Writing
Build a block to reverse the order of a sentence by word.

## 🔄 Sdrawkcab
Build a block that reverses the order of a sentence by splitting it into a list.
