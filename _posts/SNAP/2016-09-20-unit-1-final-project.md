**You will create a short animation in SNAP depicting a scene.**

This could be a scene from a book/movie/play, depict lyrics from your favorite song, or your own unique animations

* Whenever the green flag is clicked, your SNAP animation should display your chosen scene line by line somewhere on the stage. (This should work correctly even if the last run was interrupted and restart.)

* As each line is shown, sprites should act out the story.

* The animation should advance on its own, but should do so at a pace that allows each action to complete and the viewer to read the line before the next line is shown and new action begins.

* In addition, the sprites must act out the scene; you should not simply create a series of static backgrounds or costumes that show a stop-motion version of the story.

* Each line must be readable and must stay shown while the corresponding action is occurring.

* When the story ends, there should be a way for the user to replay the entire animation from the beginning.

* You are free to be as creative as you like with your choice of sprites and actions.

* You may choose from the sprites provided by SNAP or create your own. (You will not be graded on your artistic skills.) You may interpret the scene literally or be clever with your depiction. However, *all sprites, behaviors, words, and animations must be school-appropriate.*

### **Implementation Details**

As mentioned above, your animation must display the scene in its entirety and animate each line. Action must be performed by sprites and must consist of more than simply changing costumes. You must include the following components in your animation:

* At least two sprites that act in some way to contribute to the depiction of the story

* At least one sprite that moves

* At least one sprite that rotates

* At least one sprite that changes costume

* At least one sprite that is both hidden and shown at some point

Note that multiple of these requirements may be satisfied by the same sprite (e.g. the same sprite can both move and change costume), but you must have at least two separate sprites that act in the animation.
