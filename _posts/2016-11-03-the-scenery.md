## Learning Target
I can use conditionals and variables to relate the movement of my "hero" and scenery sprites.

## Good programming habits in your code:

- Using Start and Stop blocks.
- Making sure you initialize appropriately so that your program is repeatable.
- Use conditionals and variables, **not** precisely timed waits.
- Add comments to your code so it is easy to understand.

## By the end of today...
_In your planning doc:_

| Specification | Scripts |
| -- | -- |
| There should be at least two scenery sprites | |
| You should layer these sprites relative to "Hero" and each other. | |
| Scenery sprites move relative to "Hero" as she moves. | |
| Following with the layers, scenery sprites should move at different speeds so that one seems farther away. | |
| Scenery sprites should roll over/reappear when they hit the edge of the stage. |  |
