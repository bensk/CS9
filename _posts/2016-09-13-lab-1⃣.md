## Lab Days

This is our first Lab Day. You will be working at your own pace on a series of programming challenges and projects. You are welcome to consult teachers or classmates for help or hints (and you are more than welcome to help others), but your work must be your own, and you must be able to explain it.

The expectation for Lab Days is that you are documenting your work in your code, giving credit to classmates or any other sources of assistance and inspiration.

Good luck, and have fun!
